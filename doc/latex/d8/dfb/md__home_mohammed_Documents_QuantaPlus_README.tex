Quanta\+Plus is a light numerical C++ package to solve and explore quantum mechanics problems. Quanta\+Plus uses the Eigen3 linear algebra library.\hypertarget{md__home_mohammed_Documents_QuantaPlus_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md__home_mohammed_Documents_QuantaPlus_README_autotoc_md1}
Eigen 3 (\href{https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\texttt{ https\+://eigen.\+tuxfamily.\+org/index.\+php?title=\+Main\+\_\+\+Page}}).

The package can be installed as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sudo apt-\/get install libeigen3-\/dev libeigen3-\/doc
\end{DoxyItemize}

After the installation is complete, you will find header files (on our reference platform, Ubuntu 22.\+04 LTS) in the area
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item /usr/include/eigen3
\end{DoxyItemize}

This area should be added to the include search path (using the -\/I/usr/include/eigen3 option) in the Make\+File during compilation.
